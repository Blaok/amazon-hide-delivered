# Amazon Hide Delivered
Hide delivered items on amazon.com.

## Motivation
Somehow,
  amazon.com decided not to provide an option to filter out delivered orders.
It is virtually impossible to keep track of what to expect if you have a lot of
  orders.
This script hides delivered items from order history so that you can focus on
  those yet to come.
